📦 Installation
Follow these steps to get a development environment running on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Node.js (LTS version recommended)

MongoDB (local installation or cloud service like MongoDB Atlas)

Backend Setup
Navigate to the backend directory:

cd backend # Assuming your backend code is in a 'backend' folder

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Create a .env file:
In the backend directory, create a file named .env and add your environment variables.

PORT=3000
MONGODB_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key_for_authentication
# Add any other backend specific environment variables here

Replace your_mongodb_connection_string with your MongoDB URI (e.g., mongodb://localhost:27017/ecommerce_db or your MongoDB Atlas connection string).
Replace your_jwt_secret_key_for_authentication with a strong, random string.

Run the backend server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

The backend server should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3000.

Frontend Setup
Navigate to the frontend directory:

cd frontend # Assuming your frontend code is in a 'frontend' folder

Install dependencies:

npm install
# or
yarn install

Run the frontend development server:

npm start
# or
yarn start

The frontend application should now be running, typically on http://localhost:3001 (or another port if 3000 is taken by the backend).

💡 Usage
Once both the backend and frontend servers are running:

Open your web browser and navigate to http://localhost:3001 (or the port your frontend is running on).

Register a new account if you don't have one, or log in with existing credentials.

Explore the product catalog, add items to your cart, and experience the smooth animations and responsive design.
